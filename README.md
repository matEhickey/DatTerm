# Dat Term
Implementation of a terminal/OS/Network module, in javascript, and a little game inspired by [Hacknet](http://hacknet-os.com/).  

No Server side communications, all datas are stored in the browser.  

Note that if you broke your virtual computter, you could just type the "reset" command.  

Just clone/download that repo, and open index.html in Chrome browser only, I locked the execution on others browsers.  

Enable fullscreen for better display.

**WIP** -> espect some bugs, some effects often create WebGL context creation errors, don't know why..
